File handling involves interacting with files on the filesystem to perform operations like:

Reading: Retrieving data from a file (e.g., reading user credentials).
Writing: Storing data to a file (e.g., saving new user details).
Appending: Adding data to an existing file without overwriting it.
Deleting/Modifying: Managing file content or metadata.
Java provides several classes in the java.io and java.nio.file packages for file handling. The most commonly used classes include:

File: Represents a file or directory path.
FileReader/FileWriter: For reading/writing character-based data.
BufferedReader/BufferedWriter: For efficient reading/writing with buffering.
Scanner: For parsing text with delimiters.
Files (from java.nio.file): For modern, versatile file operations.

a. Reading Files
Reading files involves accessing the content of a file. Common approaches include:

Using FileReader and BufferedReader:
FileReader reads character streams from a file.
BufferedReader wraps FileReader to reduce direct disk access, improving performance by buffering data in memory.
Example: Reading a file line by line.

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("users.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Using Scanner:
Scanner is useful for parsing structured data with delimiters (e.g., commas, spaces).
Example: Reading a CSV file with user data (e.g., admin,John,Doe,L,Jl. Merpati...,hashedPassword).

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.File;

public class ReadFileScanner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("users.txt"))) {
            scanner.useDelimiter(","); // Set delimiter to comma
            while (scanner.hasNext()) {
                String username = scanner.next();
                String firstName = scanner.next();
                String lastName = scanner.next();
                String gender = scanner.next();
                String address = scanner.nextLine().trim(); // Handle rest of the line
                System.out.println("User: " + username + ", Name: " + firstName + " " + lastName);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Using Files (Java NIO):
The java.nio.file.Files class provides a modern way to read files, especially for reading all lines at once.
Example: Reading all lines into a List<String>.

import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.List;

public class ReadFileNIO {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("users.txt"));
            for (String line : lines) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


b. Writing Files
Writing files involves storing data to a file, either overwriting existing content or appending to it.

Using FileWriter and BufferedWriter:
FileWriter writes character streams to a file.
BufferedWriter improves performance by buffering writes.
Example: Writing user data to a file.

import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("users.txt", true))) { // true for append
            writer.write("admin,John,Doe,L,Jl. Merpati No. 1 RT 1 RW 1, Banten,hashedPassword");
            writer.newLine();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Using Files (Java NIO):
Simplifies writing by providing methods like write or writeString.
Example: Writing a list of strings.

import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class WriteFileNIO {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Files.write(Paths.get("users.txt"), 
                        Arrays.asList("admin,John,Doe,L,Jl. Merpati No. 1 RT 1 RW 1, Banten,hashedPassword"),
                        StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

c. Buffering
Buffering reduces direct disk access, improving performance for both reading and writing:

BufferedReader: Reads chunks of data into memory, reducing the number of system calls.
BufferedWriter: Buffers data in memory before writing to disk, minimizing disk I/O.
Why Use Buffering? Without buffering, each read/write operation directly accesses the disk, which is slow. Buffering batches these operations, making your program faster, especially for large files.

Example: When reading or writing user data, use BufferedReader/BufferedWriter to handle potentially large user lists efficiently.


d. Delimiters
Delimiters are characters or patterns that separate data fields in a file (e.g., commas in CSV files, tabs, or spaces). They are crucial when parsing structured data.

Using Scanner with Delimiters:
Scanner’s useDelimiter method lets you specify a delimiter (e.g., , for CSV).
Example: Parsing a line like admin,John,Doe,L,Jl. Merpati...,hashedPassword.

scanner.useDelimiter(",");
String username = scanner.next();
String firstName = scanner.next();

Using String.split:
If you read a line with BufferedReader, you can split it using a delimiter.
Example:

String line = "admin,John,Doe,L,Jl. Merpati...,hashedPassword";
String[] parts = line.split(",");
String username = parts[0];
String firstName = parts[1];
// ... and so on

e. Other File Handling Concepts
File Object: The File class represents a file or directory path. You can check if a file exists, create a new file, or delete it.
Example:

File file = new File("users.txt");
if (!file.exists()) {
    file.createNewFile();
}

Exception Handling: File operations can throw IOException (e.g., file not found, permission issues). Always use try-catch or try-with-resources to handle these safely.
Try-with-resources: Ensures resources (e.g., BufferedReader, BufferedWriter) are closed automatically.

try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("users.txt"))) {
    // Read file
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

Appending vs. Overwriting:
Overwrite: new FileWriter("file.txt") overwrites the file.
Append: new FileWriter("file.txt", true) appends to the file.
Use StandardOpenOption.APPEND with Files for appending in NIO.
File Formats:
Text Files: Store data as plain text (e.g., CSV, TXT).
Binary Files: Use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream for non-text data (e.g., images).
Serialized Objects: Use ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream to save/restore Java objects (e.g., your User objects).

import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;

public class SerializeUser {
    public static void saveUser(User user) {
        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("user.dat"))) {
            oos.writeObject(user);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static User loadUser() {
        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("user.dat"))) {
            return (User) ois.readObject();
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }
}

public static class User implements Serializable {
    // ... existing code ...
}

Best Practices for File Handling
Use Try-with-Resources: Ensures files are closed properly, preventing resource leaks.
Handle Exceptions: Always catch IOException and handle errors gracefully (e.g., inform the user if a file can’t be accessed).
Validate Input: When reading files, validate data to prevent errors (e.g., check if the CSV has the expected number of fields).
Choose the Right Format: For your program, CSV is simple and effective, but consider JSON or serialization for more complex data.
Secure File Access: Ensure sensitive data (like passwords) is hashed or encrypted before storing.
Thread Safety: If your program becomes multi-threaded, synchronize file access to prevent concurrent modification issues.


Summary
Reading: Use BufferedReader for text files, Scanner for delimited data, or Files for modern NIO operations.
Writing: Use BufferedWriter for efficiency or Files for simplicity; choose append or overwrite based on needs.
Buffering: Reduces disk I/O, making operations faster.
Delimiters: Use Scanner or String.split to parse structured data like CSV.
